# UX303UB-El-Capitan
This repo is for my Hackintosh Project El Capitan UX303UB-R4111T. Why? Just because I wanted to.

# My Laptop Specs
You can google the full specs for my model, but just to give a few:
* Intel Core i5-6200U Broadwell Edition
* Intel HD Graphics 520 1536 MB
* Nvidia Geforce 940M
* 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
* 256GB SSD
* Intel Wireless-AC 7265 (M.2 NFGG Card)
* 3 x USB 3.0 (Intel)

# WIFI-Card Problem
I had to replace the build-in WiFi-Card with the BCM94352Z DW-1560.

# What does not work
* Dedicated Graphics (No driver for the 940M)
* Bluetooth (Should work normally, but since I don't need it I won't work on it)
* Three finger trackpad gesture, but everything else I think
* Sleep mode (The laptom sometimes freezes in the sleep mode and has to be restarted)

# Conclusion
You are free to use my files for your project. No guarantee for anything!
